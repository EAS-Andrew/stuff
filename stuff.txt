Diagram 1: Teams provide an MPW glassbreak account during onboarding that will be used for approving deployments.

During the onboarding process, teams are required to provide an MPW (Multi-Person Workflow) glassbreak account. This account serves as a crucial component for the approval process of deployments. By utilizing this account, teams can ensure that only authorized individuals can review and approve changes before they are deployed.

The MPW glassbreak account acts as a centralized platform where teams can collaborate and coordinate their efforts to assess the readiness of deployments. It serves as a secure channel through which teams can request and obtain the necessary approvals from relevant stakeholders. By utilizing this dedicated account, teams can streamline the deployment approval process and ensure that all necessary checks and balances are in place before moving forward.

Diagram 2: When a developer is ready to promote a change to an environment - They raise a pull request against the target environment branch. Branch protection rules specified in the repository for any environment branches enforce 2 required approvals for pull requests, one of which needs to be by the approvers group. This enforces both a four-eyes check and the necessary actor with a valid ServiceNOW change record must approve the deployment.

When a developer is prepared to promote a change to a specific environment, they initiate the process by raising a pull request against the corresponding target environment branch. To ensure a robust and controlled deployment workflow, the repository is configured with branch protection rules that dictate the required steps for pull request approvals.

According to these rules, any pull request targeting environment branches must have at least two approvals. This requirement serves two essential purposes. First, it enforces a "four-eyes check," meaning that multiple individuals must review the proposed changes to minimize the likelihood of errors or oversights. By involving more than one set of eyes, the chances of detecting potential issues are significantly improved.

Additionally, one of the required approvals needs to come from the designated approvers group. This group consists of individuals with the authority and expertise to evaluate the changes based on specific criteria and guidelines. Their approval ensures that the deployment aligns with established standards and best practices.

Furthermore, the branch protection rules also specify that the necessary actor with a valid ServiceNOW change record must approve the deployment. This requirement ensures that only authorized individuals, who have followed the proper change management process within the ServiceNOW system, can grant approval for the deployment. By incorporating this additional layer of validation, organizations can maintain a high level of control and accountability over the deployment process, mitigating potential risks and ensuring compliance with established protocols.
